We opted for the use of the ORM Sequelize. This decision was justified by the fact that it simplifies interaction with the database, and allows for better code readability.\nAfter completing all these steps and installing Sequelize in the project, we created the Sequelize templates.

For example, we may retrieve specific information, add new data, update existing records or delete them from the database.\nUsing NodeJS also gives us the ability to asynchronously manage incoming requests, which helps optimize performance and ensure a responsive user experience.
